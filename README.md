I use HackerRank in multiple ways as required by the user. We can use HackerRank as coding practice platform, where we can practice coding questions in different languages and get rewarded by Badges based on number of problems that you solve. It is fun to solve those problems and also you can increase your rank in the leader board.
HackerRank is a technology hiring platform that is the standard for assessing developer skills for over 2,800+ companies around the world. By enabling tech recruiters and hiring managers to objectively evaluate talent at every stage of the recruiting process, HackerRank helps companies hire skilled developers and innovate faster!
